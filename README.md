Visualisation of various parameters and attributes concerning the novel Corona-virus disease outbreak.

Visualization of epidemic infections are very important to be visualized by decision
making authorities and by the general public. One of the best methods to prevent
infectious diseases such as the Coronavirus is to continuously update our
knowledge with useful information from infectious disease information systems and
taking active steps to safeguard ourselves against infectious diseases.

## We have used two main data sources
  1.  Coronavirus Dataset

      ● Source:https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset?select=covid_19_data.csv

      ● Dataset Type: Geometry (Spatial)

  2.  Stocks Dataset

      ● Source: Yahoo Financial API

      ● Dataset Type: Time Series

## We visulaised various plots using plotly library

## Conclusion

- Data Visualization plays a key role in the healthcare industry. It is used to determine the trend of the outbreak, help predict the extent of the outbreak and take necessary precautions. 
- Plots like the Epidemiology Curve give us an idea of what kind outbreak it is, the incubation period, etc. and help in taking measures to contain it.
- The Logistic Graphs and Spread Plots help us visualize which countries are dealing with the pandemic effectively and which countries poorly and hence take inspirations, ideas and lessons from them.
- The Timeseries Map representation helps us to visualize how the virus spread and help us predict which way it will spread in the future. 
- Pandemics like Coronavirus affect not only the healthcare industry but also the entertainment industry, travel industry and many more. By Comparing Stock Value of different industries we can see how exactly the pandemic has affected the global economy and which companies are thriving and which are falling behind. Visualization is important to help better understand the growth and effect on other industries.
